It is prescribed in pre-surgery screening, in the exploration of an hemorrhagic syndrome and in the case of an isolated APTT prolongation. It is however poorly sensitive to mild hypofibrinogenemia (0.8 – 1.5g/l) ; however it is prolonged in the case of dysfibrionogenemia and in the case of pronounced hyperfibrinogenemia. It is also prolonged in the presence of monoclonal proteins, high concentrations of fibrin or fibrinogen degradation products and in acute fibrinolysis states. For this reason, some pathologists use it in the diagnosis and follow-up of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).</br>TT is highly sensitive to heparin traces in the plasma sample, although it is not recommended for heparin treatment where monitoring by the anti-Xa activity measurement is preferred.</br>TT is not prolonged either in patients receiving vitamin K antagonists or in patients receiving direct factor xa antagonists such as rivaroxaban or antiplatelet therapy such as clopidogrel. However, TT is highly sensitive to DTIs such as dabigatran and can allow one to suspect dabigatran intake although it is non-specific. This high sensitivity may lead to an uncoagulable test at supratherapeutic dabigatran plasma concentrations. APTT looks more appropriate than TT for dabigatran monitoring. Nevertheless specific DTIs assays such as the Ecarin Chromogenic Assay (ECA), derived from the original ecarin clotting time, is standardized, insensitive to the common interferences occurring in the clotting assay, and is CE marked.</br>TT is routinely used to ensure the absence of heparin in the plasma. However, one must keep in mind that heparin is not the sole source for TT prolongation.</body></html>"

Screening for inherited thrombophilia consists of tests that allow one to identify the major recognized risk</br>factors : measurement of antithrombin, protein C and protein S activities, screening for activated protein C resistance (aPCR), and prothrombin G20120A gene mutation. If the aPCR screening test is positive, it is recommended to confirm by R506Q factor V gene mutation (factor V Leiden) that will allow to determine if the patient is either heterozygous or homozygous if the mutation is present. Of note the basic measurement of factor V or factor II activities cannot identify patients having one or the other mutation.<p>These risk factors, isolated or in association, are nevertheless found in only roughly half of patients having experienced a thromboembolic event.<p>Besides inherited thrombophilia, screening for lupus anticoagulant (LA) must also be performed. This screening is performed using the dilute Russel's viper venom time (dRVVT) and a LA sensitive APTT, according to the ISTH international recommendation.<p>Other inherited and/or acquired thrombophilia risk factors have been described, but are not routinely included in the thrombophilia panel; these are:<ul><li>hyperhomocystinemia the origin of which can be:<ul><li>either acquired because of a vitamin deficiency;<li>or inherited linked to a methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase gene mutation or, less frequently to a cystathionine beta synthase gene mutation.</ul><li>high levels of factor VIII,<li>some dysfibrinogenemias,<li>...</ul>Inherited thrombophilia must be first screened using a functional assay that allows the detection of both qualitative and quantitative defects.
