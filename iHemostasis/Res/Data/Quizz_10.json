Penicillin may have been described associated with the presence of factor VIII specific inhibitors in children. On the other hand, antibiotic treatment may interfere with intestinal bacteria. This may result indirectly in a lower plasma vitamin K level. Consequently vitamin K-dependent factor levels can be decreased. However, as stated in Question 3, intrinsic pathway coagulation factors are normal; this excludes both the presence of a factor specific inhibitor and low vitamin K-dependent factor levels.<br><br>Antiplatelet treatment (aspirin, clopidogrel – PLAVIX® -, ticlopidin – TICLID® -, prasugrel - EFIENT® -, ticagrelor – BRILIQUE® -) have no effect on aPTT level. In some cases, aPTT is prolonged, but further investigation is inconclusive. This may be related to certain contact phase factor deficiencies (according to reagent sensitivity and nature of defect). This diagnosis is usually not routinely performed as there is no associated clinical impact.

Asymptomatic venographic DVT occurs in 40% to 60% of cases without prophylaxis, and symptomatic venous thromboembolism, including fatal PE in up to 5%. The use of an appropriate prophylaxis allows a significant reduction of these events. <h2>B/ Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT) is a rare but life threatening complication of heparin treatment in major orthopaedic surgery – TRUE</h2>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT) is an immunoallergic reaction associated with a platelet count fall linked to IgG isotype antibodies directed against neo-complexes formed between heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4). In some cases it can be complicated with an activation of coagulation leading to thrombotic and possibly life threatening manifestations. HIT is more frequent in patients receiving unfractionated heparin than in patients receiving low molecular weight heparin and is also more frequent in surgery patients than in medical patients.<h2>C/ Thrombophilia work-up is mandatory before major orthopaedic surgery – FALSE</h2>Patient's management is based on specific and standardised interviews allowing to detect personal and family bleeding or thrombosis history. If no information indicates that any thrombotic risk is present, no laboratory thrombotic risk factor assessment is usually performed.<h2>D/ D-dimer level is usually high after total knee replacement – TRUE</h2>D-dimer is a fibrin-specific degradation product. D-dimer level is increased in some pathophysiological situations such as e.g. inflammation, pregnancy, cancer, DIC, in postsurgical period, severe infectious disease, and DVT and PE. For these reasons, predictive positive value is relatively low. In contrast, negative predictive value is high and allows, in combination with a pre-test clinical score (e.g. Wells score) to safely rule out VTE if D-dimer result is below cut-off level. <h3>References</h3><ul><li>Mueck W, Schwers S, Stampfuss J.
