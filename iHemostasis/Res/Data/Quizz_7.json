In rare circumstances, a non-haemophiliac subject can develop specific antibodies against factor IX (factor IX inhibitor). This situation can be associated with spontaneous bruising at an unusual location (e.g. arm) and low factor IX level. It is called acquired haemophilia. This may happen in the elderly, cancer, autoimmune disease, pregnancy or as idiopathic. Bleeding manifestations may be life threatening. Patients should be managed in specialised centres. It is important that clinical labs recognise such cases.<h1>B/ Rivaroxaban intake can interfere in factor IX clotting assay – TRUE</h1>Rivaroxaban is a direct oral direct factor Xa inhibitor. It prolongs PT and aPTT in a dose-dependent manner and according to reagent sensitivity. It can therefore interfere with factor assays and lead to factor level underestimation. It is recommended to perform serial sample dilutions in order to abolish or limit this interference.<h1>C/ Lupus anticoagulants do not interfere in factor IX clotting assay</h1>Lupus anticoagulants may prolong phospholipid-dependent clotting times according to reagent sensitivity. They can prolong aPTT and related tests like intrinsic factor assays, including factor IX assay. For this reason, it is recommended to perform serial sample dilutions for intrinsic pathway factor assays. This allows to abolish or limit LA interference.<h1>D/ About 20% of haemophiliac patients suffer from haemophilia A</h1>Hemophilia A accounts for 80 – 85% of heamophiliac patients whereas haemophilia B accounts for only 15 – 20 % (cf Question 3D).<br><h2 style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">References</h2><ul><li>White GC, Rosendaal F, Aledort LM et al.
