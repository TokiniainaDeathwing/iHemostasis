It was first described in Finland in 1926 by Baron Erik von Willebrand, who noted young girls dying of a haemorrhage at puberty and called the condition \"pseudo-haemophilia\". The estimated prevalence is around <b>1% of the general population</b>.<br>It is also known to affect dogs notably Doberman pinschers.<li>Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is associated with quantitative or qualitative deficiency of a multimeric protein, Von Willebrand factor (VWF). It affects women as often as men. The abnormal gene is not on the X chromosome, but on an autosome (not sex-linked). It can be inherited as a dominant condition, however in some families it has been shown to be a recessive inheritance.<li>blood group patients have lower VWF levels than non-O blood group patients.<li>VWF is a multimeric glycoprotein made up primarily of identical subunits having a molecular weight of around 250 kDa and synthesised by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes.The size of <b>multimers</b> ranges from 500 kDa to over 10,000 kDa for multimers comprising more than 40 subunits and measuring more than 2 μm. High molecular weight multimers play an important role in platelet adhesion. Multimers of all sizes bind to factor VIII molecule which makes the FVIII molecule more stable, thus protecting against rapid proteolysis in the circulation.<li>Von Willebrand disease can thus lead to haemorrhaging with a clinical presentation typical of <b>platelet diseases or mild to moderate haemophilia A</b>, or a combination of both.<li>VWD classification is summarised in the following table:</br></br><table  border=\"1\"  frame=\"void\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-family: helvetica, verdana, sans-serif;font-size:13px; width=100%><tr align=\"center\"><th width=\"10%\">Type</th><th width=\"90%\">Description</th></tr><tr><td align=left valign=top><p style=\"margin-left:10px;\"><b>1</b></p></td><td><b>Partial quantitative VWF deficiency</b><ul><li>The most common form (50 to 70% of cases)<li>Several subtypes depending on intra-platelet VWF content<li>Difficult to diagnose: overlap between VWF levels in patients and the normal population<li>VWF levels between 10 and 50%<li>Corresponding reduction in VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) and in ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:RCo)</br>Ratio of VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag > 0.7<li>Dominant transmission with varying expression and penetrance</ul></td></tr><tr><td align=left valign=top><p style=\"margin-left:10px;\"><b>2</b></p></td><td><b>Qualitative VWF deficiency</b><ul><li>Abnormal interaction between VWF and platelets</ul></td></tr></tr><tr><td align=right valign=top><p style=\"margin-right:10px;\"><b>2A</b></p></td><td><b>Deficient platelet adhesion dependent on VWF associated with selective deficiency of high molecular weight (HMW) multimers</b><ul><li>Abnormal interaction of VWF with platelets; decreased affinity of VWF for platelets due to absence of high molecular weight and intermediate molecular weight (IMW) multimers<li>Ratio of VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag < 0.7<li>Dominant transmission with varying expression and penetrance</ul></td></tr><tr><td align=right valign=top><p style=\"margin-right:10px;\"><b>2B</b></p></td><td><b>High affinity of VWF for platelet glycoprotein Ib</b><ul><li>Adsorption of HMW multimers on platelets resulting in fluctuating thrombocytopenia<li>Dominant transmission with varying expression and penetrance</ul></td></tr></tr><tr><td align=right valign=top><p style=\"margin-right:10px;\"><b>2M</b></p></td><td><b>Deficient VWF-dependent platelet adhesion with no selective deficiency in HMW multimers</b><ul><li>Reduced affinity of VWF for platelets not associated with a multimerisation abnormality<li>Dominant transmission with varying expression and penetrance</ul></tr><tr><td align=right valign=top><p style=\"margin-right:10px;\"><b>2N</b></p></td><td><b>Market deficient in VWF binding to factor VIII</b><ul><li>Diagnosis through study of VWF binding to FVIII<li>Normal (or slightly decreased) levels of VWF (VWF:Ag and VWF:RCo)<li>Factor VIII deficit with ratio of FVIII:C / WF:Ag < 0.5<li>Recessive autosomal transmission</ul></tr><tr><td align=left valign=top><p style=\"margin-left:10px;\"><b>3</b></p></td><td><b>Complete quantitative VWF deficiency</b><ul><li>The rarest form: 1 to 3% of <li>Subjects homozygous or composite heterozygous<li>VWF undetectable<li>Extremely low levels of Factor VIII (< 10%)<li>Autosomal recessive transmission</ul></tr></table></br>As mentioned in the Table above, VWF levels are normal or slightly decreased in type 2N VWD.</br>As mentioned above VWF is involved in both plasmatic coagulation and primary haemostasis.</br></br><b>More information on …</b></br>Sadler JE et al, The Working Party on Von Willebrand Disease Classification.
