So they may accumulate in cases of renal insufficiency and lead to an overdosage, associated with an increased bleeding risk. For that reason, the physician must evaluate the kidney function by calculating the Creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft formula before prescribing LMWH treatment.Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the best overall index of kidney function. Normal GFR varies according to age, sex, and body size, and declines with age. NKF's(US National Kidney Foundation) KDOQI (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative. www.kidney.org) clinical practice guidelines recommend the MDRD Study equation to estimate GFR.LMWH prescription is contraindicated in cases of severe renal impairment as defined by a  creatinine clearance less than  30 mL/min.</body></html>"

Patients who undergo cardiac or orthopaedic surgery and receive UFH have a higher risk of HIT than medical or obstetric patients.

Functional assays include platelet aggregation tests and radiolabelled serotonin release assay. These assays are limited to specialized laboratories. Immunologic assays consist in specific antibody detection. A rapid assay with a high Negative Predictive Value (NPV) allows diagnosis exclusion at acute phase and allows to avoid inadequate costly and difficult to manage alternative treatment to heparin.</body></html>"
