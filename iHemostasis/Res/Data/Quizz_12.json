However, PT and aPTT can be normal in conditions such as mild deficiency in coagulation factor(s) and mild form of von Willebrand disease, as well as factor XIII deficiency.<br>In addition, because of their limited impact on routine coagulation assays, anticoagulant agents such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, fondaparinux and low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) may complicate the interpretation of coagulation tests. The impact of the drugs depends on the drug concentration as well as the reagent sensitivity; PT and aPTT may not be affected or are minimally affected even by therapeutic drug levels. Noteworthy, PT and aPTT results cannot be used for drug level monitoring. As a consequence, a potential bleeding risk can be missed in patients receiving such therapy, when relying only on PT and aPTT tests. Tests results must be consolidated with the clinical information, especially by retrieving any current anticoagulant treatment.<br><br>In patients with stabilised vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment, the INR target is above 2 whatever the indication.

Due to the long half-life of the drug, a steady state concentration of the drug is reached only 2 or 3 days after first administration. <h2>B/ Severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) is not a contraindication to fondaparinux therapy - FALSE</h2>Fondaparinux is fully excreted unchanged in the urine. Therefore any renal function deterioration impacts drug elimination. Consequently, fondaparinux should be used with caution in patients with reduced creatinine clearance and fondaparinux is contraindicated in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min).<h2>C/ Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a common adverse effect of fondaparinux therapy- FALSE</h2>HIT is a severe complication of heparin therapy with potentially devastating or fatal consequences. Fondaparinux does not interact with platelet factor 4 in vitro, suggesting that it is unlikely to cause HIT. The incidence of thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 100.109/L) with fondaparinux (2-4.9%) is similar to that with enoxaparin (3-5.3 %). Thrombocytopenia was not reported as a serious adverse event in any trial and only few sporadic cases of HIT have been reported so far in the literature.<h2>D/ A specific test setup is necessary for an accurate measurement of fondaparinux anti-Xa activity - TRUE</h2>When laboratory uses fondaparinux to form the standard curve to measure fondaparinux levels with anti-Xa assay, results reported as gravimetric units (µg/mL) are impressively accurate, confirming that this is the preferred method for fondaparinux measurement. Results obtained using a LMWH standard curve are less accurate whereas results obtained using a UHF standard curve are inaccurate and should not be used for reporting of fondaparinux levels. <h2>References</h2><ul><li>Reverter J.C.
