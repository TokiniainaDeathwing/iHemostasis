His treatment is stabilized and last week, his PT/INR ordered by the physician was measured at 2.2. He presented with oral thrush and started a local antifungal treatment (fluconazole) 48 hours ago. Today, he comes for a PT/INR check before his next visit to the cardiologist scheduled for tomorrow.\n\nROUTINE LABORATORY RESULTS:\nRoutine test results are as follows:\nPT (STA® Neoplatine® CI Plus):\n     - 35.0 s (control: 12.9 s), 24%\n     - PT ratio: 2.71\n     - INR: 3.40",

			"explanation":"<html><body style=\"font-family: helvetica, verdana, sans-serif;font-size:13px; margin-left:0px;\">Antifungal drugs are among the list of known VKA interfering drugs.</br>Miconazol is known to increase the VKA anticoagulant effect. This is observed whatever the route of administration, including mucosal application. Due to drug-drug interaction this usage is contra-indicated.</br>Fluconazole is associated with a similar additive effect, although less significant. Its usage in association with VKA is not recommended. However, this alternative treatment may be considered with cautious INR management and dose adjustment.</br>It is therefore not appropriate to replace fluconazole by miconazole.</br>Advances in the knowledge of warfarin metabolism utilizing cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme and of vitamin K VKORC1 metabolism permit a better understanding of these interferences.</br>A comprehensive list of potential drug, food and dietary supplement interactions with warfarin is provided by the 9th edition of the American College of Chest Physicians evidences-based clinical practice guidelines on pharmacology and management of the vitamin K antagonists and also from the FDA website. VKA monitoring is based on validated algorithms that are available from health authorities and scientific associations.<p>In this case, the VKA dosage has to be lowered: the next dose should be skipped, and INR measured the day after. If necessary a second dose should also be skipped, and VKA treatment resumed using a lower dosage, with close INR management.</br>Generally speaking, concomitant drug use modification (introduction of a new drug, discontinuation of a drug, or a change in one or more drug dosages) requires more frequent INR monitoring.</br>Vitamin K administration is limited to INR values equal or above 5 (ACCP recommendation).</body></html>"

Alternatively, it is suggested to omit a dose and to administer vitamin K (1 to 2.5 mg) orally, particularly if the patient is at an increased risk of bleeding (Grade 2A).<p>Furthermore, INR variation in a stabilized patient must be considered carefully. A significant INR increase within a week should draw immediate lab and physician attention to avoid   potential overdosage.</body></html>"

However, such influences remain mostly of limited importance, since   regular food intake is limited to around 80 µg/day. Even though this intake could have an impact on INR, this would result in a lower INR rather than in an increased one.<p>Local antifungal treatment is very likely to have induced the INR increase (cf Question1).<p>A patient's age is an important feature to consider when initiating   VKA treatment: the elderly are more sensitive to VKA and often require a lower dosage than younger patients. Moreover, co-morbidities increase with age and potential drug-drug interactions have to be considered.</br>In this case, however, the patient has been stabilized on VKA for a long time; therefore, a patient's age by itself, may not explain the sudden INR increase.<p>If the patient had forgotten to take his VKA treatment,   an INR decrease and not an INR increase would have been observed.</body></html>"
